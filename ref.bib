Based upon simple mathematical models that focus on the combinatorial nature of the problem, a class of algorithms is derived for which performance can be measured in a precise asymptotic probabilistic sense. The approach yields many qualitative insights and the resulting transportation schemes have many attractive practical features. For example, they have modest computational requirements, are decentralized, and are easy to visualize and implement.},

 abstract = {This paper examines a relaxed version of the generic vehicle routing problem. In this version, a delivery to a demand point can be split between any number of vehicles. In spite of this relaxation the problem remains computationally hard. The main contribution of this paper is in demonstrating the potential for cost savings through split deliveries. The solution scheme allowing for split deliveries is compared with a solution in which no split deliveries are allowed on a large set of 540 problems. Significant cost savings are realized both in terms of the total distance and the number of vehicles required. The vehicle routes constructed by our procedure, tend to cover cohesive geographical zones and retain some properties of optimal solutions.},

abstract = {The significantly expanded and updated new edition of a widely used text on reinforcement learning, one of the most active research areas in artificial intelligence. Reinforcement learning, one of the most active research areas in artificial intelligence, is a computational approach to learning whereby an agent tries to maximize the total amount of reward it receives while interacting with a complex, uncertain environment. In Reinforcement Learning, Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto provide a clear and simple account of the field's key ideas and algorithms. This second edition has been significantly expanded and updated, presenting new topics and updating coverage of other topics. Like the first edition, this second edition focuses on core online learning algorithms, with the more mathematical material set off in shaded boxes. Part I covers as much of reinforcement learning as possible without going beyond the tabular case for which exact solutions can be found. Many algorithms presented in this part are new to the second edition, including UCB, Expected Sarsa, and Double Learning. Part II extends these ideas to function approximation, with new sections on such topics as artificial neural networks and the Fourier basis, and offers expanded treatment of off-policy learning and policy-gradient methods. Part III has new chapters on reinforcement learning's relationships to psychology and neuroscience, as well as an updated case-studies chapter including AlphaGo and AlphaGo Zero, Atari game playing, and IBM Watson's wagering strategy. The final chapter discusses the future societal impacts of reinforcement learning.}

abstract="We use a local search method we term Large Neighbourhood Search (LNS) to solve vehicle routing problems. LNS is analogous to the shuffing technique of job-shop scheduling, and so meshes well with constraint programming technology. LNS explores a large neighbourhood of the current solution by selecting a number of ``related'' customer visits to remove from the set of planned routes, and re-inserting these visits using a constraint-based tree search. Unlike similar methods, we use Limited Discrepancy Search during the tree search to re-insert visits. We analyse the performance of our method on benchmark problems. We demonstrate that results produced are competitive with Operations Research meta-heuristic methods, indicating that constraint-based technology is directly applicable to vehicle routing problems",

abstract = {A heuristic algorithm is described for a time-constrained version of the advance-request, multi-vehicle, many-to-many Dial-A-Ride Problem (DARP). The time constraints consist of upper bounds on: (1) the amount of time by which the pick-up or delivery of a customer can deviate from the desired pick-up or delivery time; (2) the time that a customer can spend riding in a vehicle. The algorithm uses a sequential insertion procedure to assign customers to vehicles and to determine a time schedule of pick-ups and deliveries for each vehicle. A flexible objective function balances the cost of providing service with the customers' preferences for pick-up and delivery times close to those requested, and for short ride times. Computational experience with the algorithm is described, including a run with a real database of 2600 customers and some 20 simultaneously active vehicles. The scenario for the application of the algorithm is also discussed in detail.}

abstract = {Sequential decision making describes a situation where the decision maker (DM) makes successive observations of a process before a final decision is made. In most sequential decision problems there is an implicit or explicit cost associated with each observation. The procedure to decide when to stop taking observations and when to continue is called the ‘stopping rule.’ The objective in sequential decision making is to find a stopping rule that optimizes the decision in terms of minimizing losses or maximizing gains, including observation costs. The optimal stopping rule is also called optimal strategy and optimal policy. A wide variety of sequential decision problems have been discussed in the statistics literature, including search problems, inventory problems, gambling problems, and ‘secretary-type’ problems. In the psychological literature, sequential decision problems are better known as optional stopping problems. Contrary to the objective of statisticians or economists, psychologists are less interested in determining the optimal stopping rule, but in finding variables that affect human decision behavior on sequential decision tasks. Optimal decision strategies are considered as normative models, and their predictions are compared to actual choice behavior.}

The new heuristic does not only consider the classical incremental distance measure in the insertion evaluation criteria but also the cost of reducing the time window slack due to the insertion. We also present a non-standard measure, crossing length percentage, in the insertion evaluation criteria to quantify the visual attractiveness of the solution. We compared our heuristic with a sequential and a parallel insertion heuristic on different benchmarking problems, and the computational results show that the proposed heuristic performs better with respect to both the standard and non-standard measures.}

Given the intrinsic difficulty of this problem class, approximation methods seem to offer the most promise for practical size problems. After describing a variety of heuristics, we conduct an extensive computational study of their performance. The problem set includes routing and scheduling environments that differ in terms of the type of data used to generate the problems, the percentage of customers with time windows, their tightness and positioning, and the scheduling horizon. We found that several heuristics performed well in different problem environments; in particular an insertion-type heuristic consistently gave very good results.},
